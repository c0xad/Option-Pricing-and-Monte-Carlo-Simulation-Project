Option Pricing and Monte Carlo Simulation Project
=================================================

This project implements various option pricing models and Monte Carlo simulation techniques for financial derivatives. It includes real-time pricing capabilities, multiple option types, and advanced variance reduction methods.

1. Overview
-----------
The project consists of several Python modules that work together to price options and simulate financial markets. The main components are:

- Main script (main.py)
- Real-time pricing module (real_time_pricing.py)
- Stochastic processes
- Option models
- Monte Carlo simulation
- Variance reduction techniques
- Utility functions

2. Option Types
---------------
The project supports various option types, including:

- European options (Call and Put)
- American options
- Asian options
- Barrier options
- Lookback options
- Rainbow options
- Spread options
- Digital options
- Cliquet options

3. Pricing Models
-----------------
3.1 Black-Scholes Model

The Black-Scholes model is implemented for European option pricing. The implementation can be found in

3.2 Monte Carlo Simulation

Monte Carlo simulation is used for pricing various option types. The general approach is implemented in the MonteCarloSimulator class

4. Stochastic Processes
-----------------------
4.1 Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM)

The project uses GBM to model asset price movements. The implementation can be found in the GeometricBrownianMotion class.

4.2 Jump-Diffusion Process

A Jump-Diffusion process is also implemented to model sudden price jumps

5. Variance Reduction Techniques
--------------------------------
The project implements several variance reduction techniques to improve the efficiency of Monte Carlo simulations:

5.1 Antithetic Variates
5.2 Control Variates

These techniques are implemented in the variance_reduction.py module.

6. Multi-Level Monte Carlo (MLMC)
---------------------------------
MLMC is implemented to further improve the efficiency of option pricing. The implementation can be found in the MLMC_Simulator class in mlmc.py.

7. Real-time Pricing
--------------------
The project includes real-time pricing capabilities using market data fetched from Yahoo Finance. The process involves:

1. Fetching historical price data
2. Calculating historical volatility and drift
3. Pricing options using the calculated parameters

8. Usage
--------
To run the option pricing simulations, execute the main.py script:

python main.py

This will perform option pricing for multiple stocks and option types, displaying results and generating charts. 

9. Dependencies
---------------
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- yfinance

Install the required dependencies using:

pip install -r requirements.txt

10. Future Improvements
-----------------------
- Implement additional stochastic processes (e.g., Heston model)
- Add more exotic option types
- Enhance visualization capabilities
- Implement parallel computing for faster simulations
- Integrate with real-time market data APIs for live trading scenarios
